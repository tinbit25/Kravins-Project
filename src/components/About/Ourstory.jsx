            We are 3 foreigners in Rwanda who have seen the need for a model like Kravinz in Rwanda. 
            Our mission is to unite cultures through the universal language of food, bridging the 
            gap for foreigners by offering a taste of home and a way to culinary exploration.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed  mt-4">
            We believe that every meal shared is an opportunity to foster connection and understanding. 
            With passion and purpose, we empower individuals to savor the richness of diversity, one 
            dish at a timeâ€”enriching lives and households one kitchen at a time.
