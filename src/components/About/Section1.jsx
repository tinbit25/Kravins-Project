          As three foreigners living in Rwanda, we recognized a need for a service like 
          <span className="font-bold text-green-600"> Kravinz</span> — a model that brings the world’s flavors to your table. 
          Our mission is to unite cultures through the universal language of food, providing fellow foreigners with both a taste 
          of home and a path to culinary exploration. Every meal we share is an opportunity to foster connections, bridge cultures, 
          and cultivate understanding.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
          With passion and purpose, we’re here to empower individuals to savor the richness of diversity, one dish at a time. 
          Our goal is to enrich lives and households by transforming every kitchen into a space where culture meets creativity, 
          and where every meal becomes a moment of shared joy.
